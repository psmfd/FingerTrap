# Runtime migration activity log

Append meaningful activity in chronological order. Each entry identifies
the slice, change, observed verification, blockers and next action.
Keep private logs, credentials and operator configuration out of this file.
The compact [status board](STATUS.md) is the starting point for a new session.

## 2026-10-20 14:13 UTC — approval and durable tracking

- **Scope:** maintainer approved the HTML plan and requested continuity across
  failures/sessions. Working issue pair: #201 and #200, as disclosed in the
  approved plan; #210 lookup was unsuccessful.
- **Existing work:** accepted ADR-0034, M0 inventory/successors and inactive
  M1a package remain uncommitted on `docs/pi-runtime-migration`, based on
  `8ffeae809f7b4579d6b4f006c3f6e8414df60620`.
- **Action:** add `STATUS.md`, this activity log and root `AGENTS.md` resume
  instructions; record plan approval; prepare scoped source checkpoints.
- **Evidence:** inspected current worktree and package/sidecar settings.
  Earlier M1a verification is preserved in `m1a-import.md`; no new runtime
  results are claimed by this entry.
- **Important implementation findings:** RPC environment is additive;
  Porta.Pty merges inherited variables in managed code and its Unix shim
  applies overrides without replacement. Profile isolation must cover both.
  Existing settings v1 tolerates unknown fields: managed selection must not
  be silently downgraded by an older executable.
- **Next:** checkpoint reviewed existing work, then implement the versioned
  profile contract and compatibility tests (S1). Hosted CI and remote backup
  remain pending until actual results are recorded.

## 2026-10-20 14:19 UTC — baseline checkpoint verification

- **Slice:** S1, preserve the already completed migration baseline.
- **Checks:** package provenance (20 files), lint, typecheck and all 41 meter
  tests passed again. The existing Node 24/tsx deprecation warning remains.
  Repository checks passed with zero errors/warnings. Gitleaks default rules
  found no leaks in the exact 46-file staged export; no suppressions.
- **Remote identity:** authenticated GitHub read confirms the canonical public
  repository is `psmfd/FingerTrap`; #200 and #201 are still open. No existing
  migration PR appeared in the open-PR read.
- **Checkpoint:** staged reviewed baseline plus durable records; excluded all
  three private/local artifacts. Commit and remote backup follow this entry.
- **Next:** profile contract/fixtures and explicit old-build rejection.

## 2026-10-20 — baseline backed up; S1 contract implementation

- **Recovery checkpoint:** `6a999c9` is pushed to the canonical public
  `psmfd/FingerTrap` repository on `docs/pi-runtime-migration`.
  [Draft PR #207](https://github.com/psmfd/FingerTrap/pull/207) targets `dev`.
- **Contract:** ADR-0035 requires settings v2 for managed selectors so an old
  v1-only executable fails closed. Existing v1/user-managed behavior remains.
  Profile definitions and path layout receive common C#/TypeScript fixtures.
- **Pinned-source audit:** exact fork `e7d09c9…` includes agent/session
  directory overrides and `--no-context-files` alongside other discovery
  flags. This is source evidence, not yet real-process qualification.
- **In progress:** implement and test S1. Managed selection must fail clearly
  before any executable fallback while activation remains unavailable.
- **First validation:** TypeScript lint/typecheck passed. A new environment
  non-mutation assertion compared Node's special `process.env` object with a
  plain snapshot, causing a prototype mismatch; corrected it to compare two
  plain snapshots. This was a test assertion issue, not a path/runtime failure.
  C# build and hosted baseline CI results are still being collected.

## 2026-10-20 — baseline CI evidence and dependency repair

- **Baseline CI:** the Node 22 runtime-package and UI jobs passed on all
  three platforms; repository/workflow checks and CodeQL passed.
  [Run 39439548689](https://github.com/psmfd/FingerTrap/actions/runs/39439548689)
  failed all sidecar/Tauri jobs during restore due to existing
  `MessagePack 2.5.302` (NU1902, treated as error).
- **Cause and bounded repair:** StreamJsonRpc transitively selects that
  version. The upstream [advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qhrr-8q5h-9q3h)
  identifies 2.5.303 as the patched 2.x release. Add an explicit 2.5.303
  dependency floor and regenerate only affected RID-agnostic locks; retain
  audit enforcement. Review/test this separately from the profile contract.
- **Local checks:** TypeScript suite now passes all 68 tests. Sandboxed .NET
  build stalled; stopped that process and reran single-worker without shared
  compilation outside the sandbox. Production code compiled; test build
  requires the previously absent FakeMcm assets, now restored from its lock.
- **Next:** restore the patched dependency, complete C# tests and prove the
  managed fallback regression fails its guard test before checkpointing S1.

## 2026-10-20 14:48 UTC — S1 verified locally

- **Implementation:** ADR-0035, v1/v2 settings boundary, managed resolver
  refusal, C#/TypeScript profile validation/path projection and 25 shared
  contract cases. Meter source remains unchanged/inactive.
- **Final local checks:** 69 runtime tests passed; provenance 20/20, lint and
  typecheck passed. Audited locked NuGet restore passed. Sidecar Release
  build had zero warnings/errors; 359 tests passed, 12 skipped, zero failures.
  Repository checks and whitespace checks passed.
- **Regression evidence:** temporarily disabling only the resolver's managed
  guard caused both explicit-path and ambient-path cases to fail because no
  exception was thrown. Restored the source byte-for-byte, rebuilt and reran
  the full green suite. No temporary mutation remains.
- **Durable evidence:** [profile-foundation.md](profile-foundation.md).
- **Next:** separate dependency/S1 checkpoints, remote backup and hosted CI;
  then S2 reviewed import/test manifest generalization.
